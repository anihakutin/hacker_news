# HackerNews

This gem will allow you to read articles from hacker news.
This gem was built using the HN api.
The cli will allow you to test it's functionality and built in methods.

# The api_connector class

The api connector has a variety of article methods(#top_articles, #latest_articles etc.).
Each method will return an array with the requested article data in the hash format.
The above methods operate by using it's #get_page_date method and #genrate_article method.
The getter method will be called only if the articles weren't loaded before and it will save into it's respective variable.

The #get_page_date method takes in the page name and returns the article id's from that page.
```
def get_page_data(page = "newstories")
  # base URL
  base_url = "https://hacker-news.firebaseio.com/v0/"
  # build URL with requested page
  uri = URI(base_url + "#{page}.json" )
  # get page data
  response = Net::HTTP.get(uri)
  story_ids = JSON.parse(response)
end
```

The #genrate_article method takes in article id's and returns an array of article data as a hash.
```
def generate_article(page_data, count = 1)
 ...

 story_url = "https://hacker-news.firebaseio.com/v0/item/" + "#{page_data[i]}.json"
        story_uri = URI(story_url)
        #get page data
        story_response = Net::HTTP.get(story_uri)
        story = JSON.parse(story_response)
        # article hash builder
        new_story = {:title => story["title"] ||= nil,
                    :id => story["id"] ||= nil,
                    :type => story["type"] ||= nil,
                    :author => story["by"] ||= nil,
                    :time => story["time"] ||= nil,
                    :text => story["text"] ||= nil,
                    :url => story["url"] ||= nil,
                    :parent => story["parent"] ||= nil,
                    :descendants => story["descendants"] ||= nil,
                    :kids => story["kids"] ||= nil}
  ...
```
The #get_comments method works by passing in the child id's returned by #kids_by_id method from the article class.

# The article class

The article class get's intialized with article properties(title, text, id, children etc.).
Articles are generated with a #create_from_collection method. This method takes a hash of article data and returns an array with article objects.
The #create_from_collection method check for exsisting articles and only creates new articles.

The article class implements mutiple methods to sort, find, and search article objects. There is also an #all and #clear method.
